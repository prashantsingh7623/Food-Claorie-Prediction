# Food-Claorie-Prediction

This appplication can classify the food items and can provide static estimate of calorie. The data used to train is available at https://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/datasets_extra/food-101/. The food-101 dataset contains 101 varieties of food items, hence it gives us good amount of data to train and test our modle.
We have used Inception V3 image recognition model with tensorflow.
The calories are statically added, since we are finding our way to calculate the volume of the food items.
